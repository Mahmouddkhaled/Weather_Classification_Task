\# Weather Classification Task 🌦️



\## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies 'Logistic Regression' to classify weather conditions based on given features.

It demonstrates a typical 'data science workflow': data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.



\## 📊 Dataset

\- Source: https://github.com/Mahmouddkhaled/Weather_Classification_Task

\- Contains weather-related features such as MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, Evaporation, Sunshine, WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Cloud9am, Cloud3pm, Temp9am, Temp3pm.

\- Target variable: RainTomorrow (yes , no)



\## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1\. 'Data Cleaning' – handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features.

2\. 'Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)' – statistical summaries and visualizations.

3\. 'Feature Engineering' – preparing features for modeling.

4\. 'Modeling' – Logistic Regression model for classification.

5\. 'Evaluation' – recall\_score, accuracy\_score, precision\_score, f1\_score, classification\_report.
